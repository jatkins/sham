This is my implementation for EngineYard's July 2009 contest:

Compiling and running
---------------------

Just run:

  $ make

The output is a single binary, 'sham'. Run ./sham for usage, or just run:

  $ ./start-sham 2

to start running two instances of sham (1 instance per core). Hit ctrl-c to kill
it.
